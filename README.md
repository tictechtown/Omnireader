Omnireader is a React Native client for [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) (a complete, open source read-it-later solution for people who like text)

## Reasons

- the Android version of Omnivore was lacking some of the options from the web version (adding newsletter or RSS)
- the Android version UI was not to my liking, so I wanted to explore other layouts

## Features

- Notes, search and sharing
- Add newsletter articles via email
- PDF support
- Labels (aka tagging)

### Upcoming Features

- Highlighting
- Offline support

## Tech

- React Native
- Expo
- Apollo GraphQL
- Zustand
